# SPL tokens assignment

This is my submission for session 2 (spl tokens). This is a simple token management tool that runs on the Solana devnet. You can **create** token mints, **create** ATAs, **mint** and **burn** tokens to and from the token accounts, **transfer** tokens from the token accounts and **delegate**(WIP) tokens.

The tool can be accessed [here](https://iamargentum.github.io/spl-tokens-assignment/).

Here's a video of how it looks (to be added) -
